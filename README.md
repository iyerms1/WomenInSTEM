# WomenInSTEM
A quiz to raise awareness of the gender gap in STEM fields
This was my final project for my Python I class at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory STEM Academy. This quiz is intended to help remove misconceptions about women in STEM and highlight how much of a problem the gender gap in this field truly is. 
The code uses if statements to determine whether or not the use inputted the correct answer and based on that adds a one or zero to an array for the score. At the end, it adds up the numbers in the score array and determines the percentage of correct answers given.
